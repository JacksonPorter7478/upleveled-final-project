# Buddies - Chat Platform

> Next.js Progressive Web App

This final project for my Web Development Bootcamp was built with Next.js. I used GraphQL for the API routes and PostgreSQL for the database. It includes user authentication and authorization.

Users register with their e-mail address, choose a profile picture, and have to select a number of pre-defined activities they enjoy. Based on their choices they will be matched with other users with similar interests. They can then start small group chats (max. 6 people) with their matches.

## Technologies

- Next.js
- JavaScript/TypeScript,
- HTML
- CSS (Emotion)
- PostgreSQL
- Apollo GraphQL (server and client)
- Deployment on Heroku
- [Ably](https://ably.com/) for the chat functionality

The PWA was made mobile-first, and then responsive to larger devices. It was end-to-end tested using Jest-Puppeteer.
