# Buddies - Chat Platform

> Next.js Progressive Web App

This final project for my Web Development Bootcamp was built with Next.js and mobile-first. I used GraphQL for the API routes and PostgreSQL for the database. It includes user authentication and authorization.

Users register with their e-mail address, choose a profile picture, and have to select a number of pre-defined activities they enjoy. Based on their choices they will be matched with other users with similar interests. They can then start group chats (max. 6 people) with their matches.
